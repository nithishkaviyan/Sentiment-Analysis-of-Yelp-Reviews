# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Yelp-Reviews

This repository contains the code for sentiment analysis performed for Yelp Reviews using <b>Bag-of-Words model</b> with Neural Network and <b>Naive Bayes Classifier</b>. Soon, I will update with a Recurrent Neural Network Model for the same sentiment classification of texts.

I have also attached few scripts and notebooks used for preprocessing steps.

The dataset consists of over 60M reviews given by over 1.5 users. The pre-processing steps and the selection of subset of reviews are also shown in the attached files.

Test Accuracy for Naive Bayes Classifier: <b>86.37%</b>

Test Accuracy for Bag-of-Words Model    : <b>91.7%</b>
